= About

Briefly what OMeta is, some links to the ometajs stuff.

= TODO

* perhaps cache compiled rb files as "#{ometa_filename}.rb.cache" or
  similar, and use them based on mtime / flag combination.
* try to optimize some more. profile wasn't particularly illuminating.
* then write some actual tests.
* i think that super is actually broken at the moment, and its not used
  in the standard grammar. the js one uses it, so could test with that.
